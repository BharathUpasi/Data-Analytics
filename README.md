# Data-Analytics
The no-show rates of patients in hospital  are as high as 30% in America. That’s missing 3 out of every 10 appointments or 3 unused slots.  When a patient misses their scheduled medical appointment, it affects more than just their health.   
Whether a practice is big or small, a significant portion of their profits – not to mention time – can be lost due to patients 
missing appointments. Reminding and rescheduling appointments can monopolize staff time unless an efficient system is installed.    
A missed medical appointment could pose serious health risks for patients as it could mean the difference between catching a
disease early on or too late. In addition, an inefficient scheduling process can wreak havoc and raise stress levels for both a 
health systems’ staff and patients.
